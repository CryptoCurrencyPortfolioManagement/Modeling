# Modeling

Directory containing all non-reinforcement-learning-based models in the masterthesis. Here for each variant of the model a seperate .py file is created. Furthermore, each of the models exist in 2 variants, one in which the weights within the portfolio are created independent of each other ({model_name}_wandb.py) and one were an additional fully connected layer is used so that the different weights in the portfolio are able to interact with each other ({model_name}_inderp_wandb.py). The model evaluation is started via wandb ("wandb agent <USERNAME/PROJECTNAME/SWEEPID>") which also provides the parameter for the model. The UploadFileToGdrive.py is a helper function storing the results generated in a gdrive directory.
